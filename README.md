This project is cloned using **React.js** and **Bootstrap**. HTML5 is totally replaced with **JSX** and CSS3 is somehow replaced with **JSS** but mostly external CSS3 is used to make design more attractive and user-friendly.

In this project, Node Package Manager (**NPM**) is used to install different package managers, frameworks and libraries like:
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Popper.js
- IcoMoon Free Font
